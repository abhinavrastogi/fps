Experiments to build a FPS game in ThreeJS

Try the demo at http://abhinavrastogi.github.io/fps/. Click once to get better mouse controls (pointer lock). Click again to shoot. WASD keys to move. Mouse to look.

Very dirty and unorganized code. Tons of bugs. Minimal features. I just started this project to try out ThreeJS two days ago!
